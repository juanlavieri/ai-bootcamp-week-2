# Algorithm: Sorting and Washing Laundry

# Tasks:
# 1. Initialize four empty baskets: whiteClothes, redClothes, delicates, otherClothes.
# 2. Loop through each item in the laundry basket:
#    a. If the item is bedding or towels, skip to the next item.
#    b. If the item is white, place it in the whiteClothes basket.
#    c. If the item is red, place it in the redClothes basket.
#    d. If the item is delicate, place it in the delicates basket.
#    e. Otherwise, place it in the otherClothes basket.
# 3. For each basket in [whiteClothes, redClothes, otherClothes]:
#    a. Put the basket of clothes in the washing machine.
#    b. Add laundry soap to the machine.
#    c. Apply the machine settings.
#    d. Turn the machine on and wait until it's done.
#    e. Remove the laundry and return it to the basket.
# 4. For the delicates basket:
#    a. Put the delicates basket of clothes in the washing machine.
#    b. Add delicate laundry soap to the machine.
#    c. Apply delicate machine settings.
#    d. Turn the machine on and wait until it's done.
#    e. Remove the delicate laundry and return it to the delicates basket.

# Pattern recognition:
# - The algorithm recognizes the need to sort laundry into different baskets based on color and delicacy.
# - Special settings are required for the delicates basket.

# Abstraction:
# - The algorithm abstracts away the details of individual laundry items, focusing on the categories (white, red, delicate, other).
# - It also abstracts the specific machine settings, as those can vary based on the machine.

# Sequence:
# The algorithm follows a sequence of steps, including sorting, washing, and returning the laundry to the appropriate baskets.
